        /*
            what I - stands for is Interface segregation principle which says that
                an interface should be as light as possible. It should contain only 1 method.
                more than one method can be there of they are serving same business logic

                for example if all fly birds can eat
                and all birds that eat can fly
                so for this can we make a separate interface that contains fly() and eat()
                        the answer is now bez of Interface segregation principle.
