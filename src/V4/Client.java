            here we have make use of all the SOLID principles and design this bird feature

            in last version we have implemented Dependency Inversion - D of SOLID principles

            which says that not to concrete classes can be directly depend on each other,
            they should be connected via an interface.

            Dependency Injection - Instead of creating an object inside a class what we can do is
            send the object as a parameter in a constructor that is known as dependency injection
